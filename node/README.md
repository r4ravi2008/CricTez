### TEZOS INDIA FELLOWSHIP 2020

# CricTez - Fantasy Crypto Cricket League

#### Category: Gaming / NFTs

## Abstract:

The idea is to develop a Fantasy Cricket Crypto Platform. The Platform represents each cricket player
participating in the league as multiple Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in the form of a Cards/Collectibles.
Each Card/Collectible is unique to its card score and ownership. Card Score is calculated considering
the real performance of the player and the previous card score. Users can buy/sell cards on the in-built

#### online marketplace and build their team.

## Detailed Explanation:

## Card Structure:

- Each Player is represented by 100 Cards (Non-Fungible Tokens) with
  Card Score = 1.0 in the beginning of league.
- Card Score increases / decreases as the league progresses.
- Four Levels of scarcity exists for each card per player:
  Gold Card: Top Card Score (Only 1)
  Silver Card: Next 5 Cards with Maximum Score (2-6)
  Bronze Card: Next 10 Cards with Maximum Score (7-17)
  White Card: Rest all cards
- Price of the Card increases as the scarcity level increases.

## Overview:

The Project is divided roughly into two sections:

- The Market Place – Trade Cards / Tokens
- The Fantasy Cricket League – Build Teams & Play

The Marketplace will allow users to:

- Claim ten free cards on sign up.
- Explore Cards with full details (name, age, country, owner, score, owner etc).
- View Card statistics for the last ten matches.
